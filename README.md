berrysethi
==========

This is a basic implementation of the Berry-Sethi algorithm in Scala.

Given a regular expression, the Berry-Sethi algorithm is used to create a
(non-)deterministic finite automaton that is able to accept or reject a given
input string with respect to that regular expression.

Refer to Berry, Sethi: "From regular expressions to determinstic automata" in
Theoretical Computer Science, Volume 48, 1986.
